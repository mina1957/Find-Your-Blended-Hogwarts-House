**Do you ever feel like you belong in more than one house? Do you ever wish that there were "combo" houses? Well, my friend, your wish just came true!**

Find Your Blended Hogwarts House is an HTML, JavaScript and CSS WebApp which sorts you into your blended/combo Hogwarts house based on your responses to a few questions. To record users' responses I used HTML forms and JavaScript and coded the sorting hat algorithm in Javascripts as well. The layout of the WebApp was achieved using CSS. The WebApp has been deployed using GitHub Pages. **Try it out now by going [here](https://mina1957.github.io/Find-Your-Blended-Hogwarts-House/)!**
