        right away to see
        what is behind!<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="act2" name="question1" value="rv">You go to the
        library to see if
        you can find out more
        about this door before doing anything.<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="act3" name="question1" value="hf">You act like
        you didn't see
        it..Which door even?<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="act4" name="question1" value="gr">You wait
        until
        everyone is
        asleep, you go back to the
        door and open it to see what is behind.<br>

        <p style="color:aliceblue">You and your friend find yourselves in front of a three-headed dog, what do you do?
        </p>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="mc" name="question3" value="gr">You try to take
        on the dog yourself and distract its view from your friend!<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="mc1" name="question3" value="rv">You quickly
        craft a plan and you get yourself and your friend out of there quickly!<br>

        never find yourself in that situation. Not in a million years.<br>

        <p style="color:aliceblue">You are having the most amazing butterbeer, but you spot one of your classmates being
            picked on, what do you do?</p>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="m1" name="question4" value="sl">You first
        consider what you can get out of defending them and if it is worth putting your butterbeer moment on pause.<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="m2" name="question4" value="gr">You put down
        your drink without thinking twice and go defend them.<br>

        formulate a brilliant plan to help them on a napkin you were using.<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="m4" name="question4" value="hf">You leave your
        drink to run and try to find a professor as they would be able to help more than you.<br>

        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="c2" name="question5" value="rv">Leave it alone:
        thereâ€™s probably a good reason for that warning signâ€¦<br>

        And donâ€™t look back.<br>
        <input style="cursor:pointer;" class="myInputs" type="radio" id="c4" name="question5" value="sl">Go in anyway!
